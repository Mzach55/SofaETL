 **Goals for Project** 
-----------------------

- Find a way to establish which games have predictaive scoring (Completed 12/26/2023)

- Create a database to store all of the games

- Test the predictative scoring algorithm from SofaScore to the final results of the game to establish how accurate their algorithm is and if it can be used for finnanical advantage at all.



**Questions to ask**
-----------------------

- Should the expected goals analysis be done for both teams simultaneously or one at a time?
- How can I expand this project beyond testing the expected goals algorithm idea?
- How should the expectation results be rounded? 
- Examples: 
  - If the home teams expectations were 3.43 and they scored 3, should I count that?
  - If the home teams expectations were 3.64 and they scored 4, should I count that?
